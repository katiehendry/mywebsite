# Debating

During my time at Strathclyde I became an active member of the Debates Society, and served as Social's Convenor during my final year. As well as being a lot of fun, debating also helped me to improve my critical thinking, public speaking and being able to articulate my thoughts.

# Music

I have also had a passion for music throughout my life, reaching Grade 6 Violin in secondary school. I have more recently became interested in playing guitar, and love to sing and attend gigs.
