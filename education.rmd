I'm currently studying for a Masters degree, Research Methods in Psychological Science. This has allowed me to develop more practical skills relating to the research process in addition to the theoretical knowledge I gained during my undergraduate degree. It is hugely beneficial to work with such distinguished researchers within their respective fields of Psychology. The course includes a range of modules, including:

        * Professional Skills
        * Data Skills for Reproducible Science
        * Qualitative Methods
        * Sleep and Circadian Timing
        * Introduction to Matlab
        * Advanced Statistics
        * Research Methods in Cognitive Science
        * Research Project
        
The title of my thesis is "Situated predictors of hair-pulling", supervised by Dr Lawrence Barsalou, and you can read more about this research project here.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Psychology at University of Strathclyde, and graduated in June 2018 with a first class degree. I was lucky to receive excellent teaching at Strathclyde, across a range of different topics within Psychology. During my honours year, I studied modules such as:

        * The Psychology of Mental Health
        * Belief and Anomalistic Experience
        * Health Psychology
        * Neuropsychology of Ageing and Dementia
        * The Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience of Face Recognition
        * Critical Review (The Relationship Between Child Abuse and Dissociation)
        * Dissertation
        
The title of my dissertation was "The role of theory of planned behaviour in Type D personality and alcohol use", and it was supervised by Dr Lynn Williams. More information on this research project can be found on the past Research Projects page.
