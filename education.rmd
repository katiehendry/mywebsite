I'm currently studying for a Masters degree, Research Methods in Psychological Science. This has allowed me to develop more practical skills relating to the research process in addition to the theoretical knowledge I gained during my undergraduate degree. It is hugely beneficial to work with such distinguished researchers within their respective fields of Psychology. The course includes a range of modules, including:

* Professional Skills
* Data Skills for Reproducible Science
* Qualitative Methods
* Sleep and Circadian Timing
* Introduction to Matlab
* Advanced Statistics
* Research Methods in Cognitive Science
* Research Project
        
The title of my thesis is "Situated predictors of hair-pulling", supervised by Dr Lawrence Barsalou, and you can read more about this research project [here](researchexperience.html).
