[Previous research](researchexperience.html) I have collaborated on has been within the areas of Health and Clinical Psychology, which are my primary research interests. I believe that investigating the reasons which underlie different health and clinical conditions is one of the most important tasks psychologists can undertake, as these can have such a huge impact on our everyday lives.

I also have a keen interest in individual differences and would love the opportunity to study constructs such as personality and intelligence in more depth. Following on from my [dissertation research](researchexperience.html), I would like to investigate whether the typology model of personality has any real merits, or whether psychologists should opt for a dimensional approach.
