My primary research interests lie within the areas of Health and Clinical Psychology, which is reflected in  [previous research](researchexperience.html) I have collaborated on. I firmly believe that investigating the reasons which underlie different health and clinical conditions is one of the most important tasks psychologists can undertake, given the huge impact of these on our everyday lives.

I also have a keen interest in individual differences and would love the opportunity to study constructs such as personality and intelligence in more depth. Following on from my [dissertation research](researchexperience.html), I would like to investigate whether the typology model of personality has any real merits, or whether psychologists should opt for a dimensional approach.
