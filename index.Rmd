I'm currently working towards an MSc in Research Methods of Psychology. My MSc thesis is being supervised by [Dr Lawrence Barsalou](http://barsaloulab.org/lab-members/lawrence-barsalou/) and we are investigating [situated predictors of hair-pulling](researchexperience.html). Upon completion of my masters, I hope to pursue a career in clinical practice, ultimately gaining entry to the DClinPsych Clinical Psychology at the University of Glasgow.
